# LLM to Mailgun

LLM to Mailgun is a Python application that integrates OpenAI's Large Language Model (LLM) with the Mailgun email delivery service to generate and send personalized emails to individual users based on their user data.

## Features

- Retrieves user data from a custom data source (replace the `get_user_data` function with your own logic)
- Utilizes OpenAI's LLM to generate personalized email content based on user data
- Sends personalized emails to users using the Mailgun API
- Supports the use of email templates with editable sections for personalized content

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenAI API credentials
- Mailgun API credentials

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/llm-to-mailgun.git
Copy code
2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Copy code
3. Set up your API credentials:
- Replace `"your_openai_api_key"` with your actual OpenAI API key in the code.
- Replace `"your_mailgun_api_key"` with your actual Mailgun API key in the code.
- Replace `"your_mailgun_domain"` with your actual Mailgun domain in the code.

## Usage

1. Prepare your email template:
- Define your email template in the `email_template` variable in the code.
- Use the `<LLM Editable>` tag to indicate the portion of the email that should be personalized by the LLM.

2. Implement the `get_user_data` function:
- Replace the placeholder `get_user_data` function with your own logic to fetch user data based on the `user_id`.
- Ensure that the function returns a dictionary containing the necessary user data fields.

3. Specify the user IDs:
- Update the `user_ids` list in the `main` function with the desired user IDs for which you want to generate personalized emails.

4. Run the application:
